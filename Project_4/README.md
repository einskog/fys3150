# Estimating the critical temperature of a 2D Ising model through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method

This is the repository for the fourth project in the Computational Physics course (FYS3150), at the University of Oslo (UiO). The project was the result of a collaboration between Einar Skoglund and Emil Kvernevik.

Keywords:
* Ising model
* Phase transition
* Probability distributions
* Markov chain Monte Carlo 
* Metropolis algorithm
* Importance sampling
* C++ parallelization with OpenMP

The scientific report generated from this project can be located in the file named `report_4.pdf` above.
All of the code content used in our project can be found in the `codescripts`-folder, along with a guide on how to compile and run them. Further, the corresponding plots for the scripts can be found in the `plots_latex`-folder.
