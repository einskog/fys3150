# Simulating the double-slit experiment by evolving the two-dimensional time-dependent Schr ̈odinger equation using the Crank-Nicolson scheme.

This is the repository for the fifth project in the Computational Physics course (FYS3150), at the University of Oslo (UiO). The project was the result of a collaboration between Einar Skoglund and Emil Kvernevik.

Keywords:
* Partial differential equations
* Crank Nicholoson Scheme
* Schrödinger equation
* Double slit experiment

The scientific report generated from this project can be located in the file named `report_5.pdf` above.
All of the code content used in our project can be found in the `codescripts`-folder, along with a guide on how to compile and run them. Further, the corresponding plots for the scripts can be found in the `plots`-folder. The animations, such as the one below, can be found in the `animation`-folder.
