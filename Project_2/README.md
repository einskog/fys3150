# Project 2

This is the repository for the second project in the course Computational Physics (FYS3150), at the University of Oslo (UiO). The project was the result of a collaboration between Einar Skoglund and Emil Kvernevik.

Main topics:
* Scaling of equations
* Eigenvalue problems
* Jacobi's rotation algorithm
* Tridiagonal matrices
* C++ functions

The report generated from this project can be located in the file named `project_2.pdf` above. All of the code content used in our project can be found in the `code_scripts` folder, along with a guide on how to compile and run them. Likewise the corresponding plots for the scripts can be found in the `plots` folder. Each script is named after the problem where it was used, and the associated plots' name correspond to the task as well.
