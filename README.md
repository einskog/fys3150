# FYS3150
My scripts and work in the Computational Physics course (FYS3150) as a result of collaboration with Emil Kvernevik.

Projects 1 and 2 address smaller problem-solving tasks, while projects 3, 4, and 5 encompass more extensive code development in addition to comprehensive scientific reporting.
